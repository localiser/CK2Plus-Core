EVTOPTC_REP_61;A glorious future awaits!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
NEVERMIND;On second thought...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900500;It has been some time since the members of my faction last met, and letters have arrived requesting that I assemble the faction in [Root.Capital.GetName]. I can postpone it for a time, but if I wait too long my position of leadership will be in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900500;Send out the invitations!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB1900500;It can wait a little longer;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900501;After I yet again failed to assemble the faction for a meeting, the other members have decided that I am unfit for leadership and have chosen a new leader.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900501;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900502;An invitation has arrived from [From.GetBestName] calling all members of my faction to assemble at [From.Capital.Name] to discuss common interests and concerns.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900502;I will attend, of course;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900503;One by one, arriving in order of rank and prestige, the Lords of the faction assemble at my residence in [Root.Capital.GetName]. As leader of the faction, it is up to me to address them and determine the agenda of this particular meeting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC1900504;One by one, arriving in order of rank and prestige, the Lords of the faction assemble at my residence in [Root.Capital.GetName]. Immediately, it is clear what is on everyone's minds: Their common enmity towards [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]. As leader of the faction, it is up to me to take charge of the situation and propose a solution to the issues raised.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900504;We must overthrow [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTB1900504;We shall present our demands to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTOPTF1900504;Now is not the time to act;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900505;After losing face in front of the assembled Lords, my support among the members of my faction has melted away. I have no choice but to give up my position of leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTTOOLTIP1900604;[Root.GetTitledFirstName] will propose to demand a concession from [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900604;"[Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] cannot forever deny us what is justly ours.", I told the assembled Lords. "Surely, [Root.Liege.GetSheHe] will see reason and...";;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTTOOLTIP1900700;Your speech is met with cheers and applause;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900700;With a steady voice and eloquent rhetoric, you deliver what is perhaps the greatest speech of your life. Praising your friends, denouncing your enemies and subtly reinforcing your virtues, you soon have the whole faction on their feet, applauding and shouting your name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900700;They will surely support me now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900701;With a steady voice and eloquent rhetoric, [From.GetBestName] delivers an inspiring speech to the assembled Lords. By the end of it you are on your feet, applauding and shouting [From.GetHerHis] name.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTOPTA1900703;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIP1900704;Your speech meets a tepid reception;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900704;Stumbling on a word here and there, you nonetheless manage to deliver a more or less coherent speech to the assembled Lords. The applause is merely polite, but at least nobody is heckling you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900704;At least I did a little good;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900705;Stumbling on a word here and there, [From.GetBestName] manages to deliver a more or less coherent speech to the assembled Lords. The applause is merely polite, but [From.GetSheHe] has at least shown some leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900705;*yawn*;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIP1900706;Your speech is poorly received;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900706;Your attempts to win over the assembled Lords with your rhetoric falls on deaf ears. You stumble on phrasing, mispronounce words and forget the name of an important noble in the room. What little applause you get at the end is muted by jeers, but at least nobody is laughing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900706;I suppose it wasn't a complete disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900707;[From.GetBestName]'s attempts to win over the assembled Lords with rhetoric falls on deaf ears. [From.GetSheHeCap] stumbles on phrasing, mispronounces words and forgets the name of an important noble in the room. What little applause there is at the end is muted by the jeers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900707;Boo!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIP1900708;You are laughed out of the room;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900708;Mere seconds after you begin to speak to the assembled Lords, you know that things are about to go badly. What follows are several long minutes of humiliation as you struggle your way through what you intended to be an inspiring speech. In the end, you are laughed out of the room and uncermoniously removed from leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900708;How could this have happened to me?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900709;Mere seconds after [From.GetBestName] begins to speak to the assembled Lords, you know that things are about to go badly. What follows is the worst speech you have been forced to listen to in your life, and the only thing louder than the jeers is the laughter. In the end, the whole faction agrees to remove [From.GetFirstName] from leadership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTOPTA1900709;Get that clown out of here!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTTOOLTIP1900710;The assembled Lords will vote on your proposal for membership dues;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900710;One by one, the assembled Lords raised their voices to vote on the payment of membership dues to strengthen the faction. At last all votes were in and...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

EVTDESC1900713;Speaking to the assembled Lords, I praised the virtues of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and reminded my fellow vassals of our duty towards our liege.

EVTDESC1900720;Speaking to the assembled Lords, [From.GetTitledFirstName] praised the virtues of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] and spoke of our duty towards our liege. However, [From.GetHerHis] weak and sycophantic arguments failed to capture the audience, and if anything managed to turn the room against the [Root.Liege.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC1900721;I have learned that [From.GetTitledFirstName] spoke [From.GetHerHis] support for me at the faction meeting in [From.Capital.GetName] but only managed to turn [From.GetHerHis] faction against me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
