EVTDESC_TOG_3100;Varangian raiders sailing from the distant north down the rivers leading into the Black Sea have proven themselves to be formidable warriors. You have managed to recruit a great many of their number into a personal guard loyal only to the [Root.GetTitle].\n\nThis new Varangian Guard will not only form a powerful shock force against the Empire's many enemies, but their foreign roots should also preclude them from becoming too entangled in the palace intrigue and power struggles that are so commonplace in the court.;Les pillards varègues qui, depuis le nord lointain, voguent sur les fleuves qui se jettent dans la mer Noire, ont prouvé qu'ils étaient de redoutables guerriers.

Euch ist es gelungen, eine große Anzahl von ihnen als Leibwache zu rekrutieren, die nur gegenüber dem [Root.GetTitle] loyal ist.\n\n Diese neue Warägergarde stellt nicht nur eine mächtige Stoßtruppe dar, ihre ausländische Herkunft sollte auch sicherstellen, dass sie nicht allzu sehr in die Intrigen und Machtspiele verwickelt werden, die so typisch für Konstantinopel sind.;;Los invasores Varangianos navegando desde el lejano norte por los ríos que llevan al Mar Negro han demostrado ser guerreros formidables.
